# What's in a name?

**I **remember reading that names are arbitrary labels. So, for example, If you

know a person by Elizabeth or Lizzie, she's still the same person"...

...later I would reflect on the famous Shakespeare Quote,

Juliet:

## "What's in a name? That which we call a rose...

...By any other name would smell as sweet."

"star-cross'd" lovers where, as I understand it, Juliet tells Romeo that a

name is essentially an artificial and meaningless convention, and she loves

the person who has this name of "Montague" and not the Montague name and

certainly not the Montague family.

### An all to passionate for Juliet Romeo, rejects that family name...

... with the vow to "deny his father" and be "new baptized" as Juliet's lover.
